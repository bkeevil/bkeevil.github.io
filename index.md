# Updates

## September 2019

Completed the development of my ESP32-Cam application. This is firmware for those ESP32-Cam modules you can get from China.

I contributed a patch to control the flash LED on some modules and it was accepted by Espressif for inclusion in their face recognition demo (ESP-WHO)

## October 2019

I'm upgrading my C++ skills. Part of this effort involves converting my MQTT client server library from Object Pascal to C++

## November 2019

Currently working on developing my C++ MQTT library on my private GOGS servere [https://git.bondkeevil.ca](https://git.bondkeevil.ca)

This project uses the TCP library that I am developing on GitHub.
